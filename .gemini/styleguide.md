# RabbitSNARK Style Guide

## Introduction

This document defines the coding standards for C++ code in RabbitSNARK. The base
guideline is the [Google C++ Style Guide], combined with the
[Angular Commit Convention], with explicit project-specific modifications. In
addition to code style, this guide incorporates our rules for commit messages,
pull requests, and IDE/editor setup.

______________________________________________________________________

## Core Principles

- **Readability:** Both code and commits should be immediately understandable.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be easy to refactor and extend.
- **Consistency:** Apply the same conventions across files and modules, except
  where external code (e.g., XLA) is imported.
- **Performance:** Prioritize clarity, but optimize carefully where latency and
  cost are critical.

______________________________________________________________________

## C++ Coding Style

The following are project-specific deviations and clarifications from the
[Google C++ Style Guide].

### Static Methods

- For **static methods** implemented in `.cc` files, explicitly annotate with
  `// static`.

  ```c++
  // static
  uint64_t EnvTime::NowNanos() {
    // ...
  }
  ```

### File-Scoped Symbols

- Wrap **file-scoped functions, constants, and variables** inside an **anonymous
  namespace**.

  ```c++
  namespace {

  constexpr int kBufferSize = 1024;

  void HelperFunction() {
    // ...
  }

  }  // namespace
  ```

### Abseil

- Prefer **`std::string_view`** instead of `absl::string_view`.

### Header Inclusion

- **Include only required headers**. Remove unused includes.

### Raw Pointer Ownership

- When using a **raw pointer** (`T*`) in **class or struct members**, explicitly
  document ownership by adding an inline comment `// not owned` or `// owned`.
- Prefer `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` for owned resources.

Example:

```c++
class Prover {
 public:
  explicit Prover(Context* ctx) : ctx_(ctx) {}

 private:
  Context* ctx_; // not owned
  std::unique_ptr<Engine> engine_;
};
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Comment Style

- Non-trivial code changes must be accompanied by comments.
- Comments explain **why** a change or design decision was made or explain the
  code for better readability.
- Use full sentences with proper punctuation.

______________________________________________________________________

## Bazel Style

- Every header included in a Bazel target must also be declared as a Bazel
  dependency.

______________________________________________________________________

## Testing

- **Framework**: Use gtest/gmock.
- **Coverage**: New features must include tests whenever applicable.
- **Completeness**: Always include boundary cases and error paths.
- **Determinism**: Tests must be deterministic and runnable independently (no
  hidden state dependencies).
- **Performance**: Add benchmarks for performance-critical code paths when
  appropriate.

______________________________________________________________________

## Collaboration Rules

### Commits (Angular Commit Convention)

- Must follow the [Commit Message Guideline].

- Format:

  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <summary>
  ```

  where `type` ∈ {build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, style,
  test}.

- Commit body: explain **why** the change was made (minimum 20 characters).

- Footer: record breaking changes, deprecations, and related issues/PRs.

- Each commit must include only **minimal, logically related changes**. Avoid
  mixing style fixes with functional changes.

### Pull Requests

- Follow the [Pull Request Guideline].
- Commits must be **atomic** and independently buildable/testable.
- Provide context and links (short SHA for external references).

### File Formatting

- Every file must end with a single newline.
- No trailing whitespace.
- No extra blank lines at EOF.

______________________________________________________________________

## Tooling

- **Formatter:** `clang-format` (Google preset with project overrides). Refer to
  the [.clang-format] file in the repo.
- **Linter:** `clang-tidy`.
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Recommended for enforcing format and lint locally.
- **CI:** All PRs must pass lint, format, and tests before merge.

______________________________________________________________________

## License

Every file (that could be exceptional case, such as empty BUILD.bazel) should
have license notice in the top.
